### First section

This is the first section in Chapter 1.

* some item
* another item
* a third item

---

Some other text.

```js
function sqr(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

```JavaScript
var x = 10 * sqr(2);
```

Some inline math: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

This is some additional text, to test the Gitbook update process. For the previous version, it did not work very well.
